# S.P.A.M.

This is a Spotify PlAylist Manager that I created for my User Interfaces class (CS 349) at the University of Waterloo.

### Installation
To run this, you will need to install [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and run it from command line with the argument "db.json".
